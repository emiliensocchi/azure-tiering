## üî¥ Tier 0: Family of Global Admins

**Description**: roles with a risk of having a direct or indirect path to Global Admin and full tenant takeover.

| Entra role | Path type | Known shortest path | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| üìå *Name of the Entra role* | *"Direct" means the escalation requires a single step to become Global Admin. "Indirect" means the privilege escalation requires two or more steps.* | *One of the shortest paths possible to Global Admin that is known with the Entra role. <br> It does **not** mean this is the most common or only possible path. In most cases, a large number of paths are possible, but the idea is to document one of the shortest to demonstrate the risk.* | *A concrete high-level example with a Threat Actor (TA), illustrating the "Known shortest path".* |
| [Application Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator) <a id='application-admin'></a> | Indirect | Can impersonate any SP with privileged application permissions granted for Microsoft Graph, which can be abused to become Global Admin. | TA identifies an SP with the [`RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory`](https://github.com/emiliensocchi/azure-tiering/tree/main/Microsoft%20Graph%20application%20permissions#rolemanagement-readwrite-directory) application permission. TA creates a new secret for the SP, impersonates it and abuses the granted permissions to escalate to Global Admin. |
| [Authentication Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#authentication-administrator) <a id='authentication-admin'></a> | Indirect | Can reset the password of a user who owns an SP with privileged application permissions granted to Microsoft Graph, impersonate the user, then impersonate the SP to become Global Admin. <br> If the targeted user has Entra ID roles, it has to be roles for which password reset is allowed for an Authentication Administrator ([more info](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/privileged-roles-permissions?tabs=admin-center#who-can-reset-passwords)). The targeted user cannot be an owner or member of a role-assignable group. | TA resets the password of a standard user who owns an SP with the granted [`RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory`](https://github.com/emiliensocchi/azure-tiering/tree/main/Microsoft%20Graph%20application%20permissions#rolemanagement-readwrite-directory) application permission (i.e. the user has no Entra role or role-assignable group assignment). TA impersonates the user, then the SP to abuse the granted application permission and escalates to Global Admin. |
| [Azure DevOps Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#azure-devops-administrator) | Indirect | Can impersonate a DevOps pipeline with assigned privileged Azure permissions, and leverage Azure resources to escalate to Global Admin. | A DevOps pipeline uses an SP with Contributor access to a subscription containing a resource with an assigned MI. The MI has privileged application permissions granted for Microsoft Graph. By triggering and impersonating the pipeline with Contributor access, the same path as [Application Administrator](#application-admin) can be followed. <br>Note: many other paths of this kind are possible. |
| [Conditional Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#conditional-access-administrator) | Direct | Can create a CAP blocking all users (including break-glass accounts) for all applications, apart from the compromised user account (making the tenant unavailable), and ask for a ransomware to remove the malicious CAP. <br>Note: this role is "Global-Admin-like", as it affects the availability of the tenant in the same way as a Global Admin. | TA creates a CAP blocking all users (including break-glass accounts) for all applications, apart from the compromised user account, and asks for a ransomware to remove the malicious CAP. |
| [Cloud Application Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator) | Indirect | Same as [Application Administrator](#application-admin). | Same as [Application Administrator](#application-admin). |
| [Directory Writers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#directory-writers) <a id='directory-writers'></a> | Indirect | Can become member of a non-role-assignable group with assigned privileged Azure permissions, and leverage Azure resources to escalate to Global Admin. <br>**Note**: can also acquire access to external solutions integrated with Entra ID via SSO, and providing access based on non-role-assignable group memberships. | TA adds the compromised user account to a group with Contributor access to a subscription containing a resource with an assigned MI. The MI has privileged application permissions granted for Microsoft Graph, and the same path as [Application Administrator](#application-admin) can be followed. <br>Note: many other paths of this kind are possible. |
| [Domain Name Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#domain-name-administrator) <a id='domain-name-admin'></a> | Indirect | Can add a federated domain to Entra ID and authenticate as an existing Global Admin without password or MFA requirements. | TA adds a federated domain to Entra ID, by importing a certificate with the domain's public key. TA generates a SAML token for an existing Global Admin with an MFA claim and signs it with the private key. TA successfully authenticates as Global Admin, without MFA requirements. |
| [External Identity Provider Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#external-identity-provider-administrator) | Indirect | Same as [Domain Name Administrator](#domain-name-admin). | Same as [Domain Name Administrator](#domain-name-admin). |

| [Identity Governance Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#identity-governance-administrator) | Indirect | Can update the assignment policy of an access package provisionning access to Global Admin, so that requesting the package without approval is possible from the compromised user account. <br>Has also the same path as [Directory Writers](#directory-writers). | TA identifies an access package providing access to a security group with an active Global Admin assignment. TA adds an assignment policy to the access package, so that the latter can be requested from the compromised user account, without manual approval. TA requests the access package and escalates to Global Admin via group membership. |
| [Intune Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#intune-administrator) | Indirect | Can run commands on a device belonging to a Global Admin and extract their tokens to impersonate them. <br> Has also the same path as [Directory Writers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#directory-writers). | TA runs a script on a device owned by a Global Administrator, extract their MS Graph tokens and escalates to Global Admin. |
